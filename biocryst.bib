		  UK-led international collective with a mission to develop,
		  test, distribute and promote software for macromolecular
		  crystallography. The CCP4 suite is a multiplatform
		  collection of programs brought together by familiar
		  execution routines, a set of common libraries and graphical
		  interfaces. The CCP4 suite has experienced several
		  considerable changes since its last reference article,
		  involving new infrastructure, original programs and
		  graphical interfaces. This article, which is intended as a
		  general literature citation for the use of the CCP4
		  software suite in structure determination, will guide the
		  reader through such transformations, offering a general
		  overview of the new features and outlining future
		  developments. As such, it aims to highlight the individual
		  programs that comprise the suite and to provide the latest
		  references to them for perusal by crystallographers around
		  the world.},

		  rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations,

		  The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice

		  tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface
		  elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour
		  (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on
		  providing tools for expert users, with customisable key
		  bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface.
		  The software is under rapid development, but has already
		  achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic
		  community. The current state of the software is presented,
		  with a description of the facilities available and of some
		  of the underlying methods employed.},

		  software was developed to solve the equations of continuum
		  electrostatics for large biomolecular assemblages that have
		  provided impact in the study of a broad range of chemical,
		  biological, and biomedical applications. APBS addresses the
		  three key technology challenges for understanding solvation
		  and electrostatics in biomedical applications: accurate and
		  efficient models for biomolecular solvation and
		  electrostatics, robust and scalable software for applying
		  those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms for
		  sharing and analyzing biomolecular electrostatics data in
		  the scientific community. To address new research
		  applications and advancing computational capabilities, we
		  have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying
		  software since its release in 2001. In this article, we
		  discuss the models and capabilities that have recently been
		  implemented within the APBS software package including a
		  Poisson–Boltzmann analytical and a semi-analytical
		  solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a
		  geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph
		  theory-based algorithm for determining pKa values, and an
		  improved web-based visualization tool for viewing

  abstract	= {One approach to phasing of macromolecular crystal
		  structure is to exploit the small changes in diffracted
		  intensities induced by the inclusion of heavy atoms, to
		  alter the wavelength in the presence of anomalous
		  scatterers, or to use a combination thereof. \\ \\ In the
		  SHELX suite of crystallographic programs, the computations
		  involved in the respective phasing procedures are divided
		  into three steps: (i) extraction of structure factors
		  representing the substructure of heavy atoms and/or
		  anomalous scatterers only (SHELXC; Sheldrick,
		  2004[Sheldrick, G. M. (2004). SHELXC, University of
		  Göttingen, Germany.]), (ii) determination of the
		  substructure (SHELXD; Schneider & Sheldrick,
		  2002[Schneider, T. R. & Sheldrick, G. M. (2002). Acta
		  Cryst. D58, 1772-1779.]), (iii) calculation of initial
		  phases based on the knowledge of the substructure and
		  improvement of these phases by density modification
		  (SHELXE; Sheldrick, 2002[Sheldrick, G. M. (2002). Z.
		  Kristallogr. 217, 644-650.]). \\ \\ A number of crystal
		  structures have been solved using the combination of the
		  programs mentioned above. However, in particular for the
		  inexperienced user, the creation of correct input files and
		  the interpretation of the intermediate results can be a
		  major obstacle. To simplify the use of the SHELX programs
		  for phasing and as a teaching tool, we have developed a
		  graphical user interface, HKL2MAP.},

		  system of computer programs from {\it SHELX}-76 to the

		  that have come into general use through their
		  implementation in {\it SHELX}, a critical analysis is
		  presented of the less-successful features, missed
		  opportunities and desirable improvements for future
		  releases of the software. An attempt is made to understand
		  how a program originally designed for photographic
		  intensity data, punched cards and computers over 10000
		  times slower than an average modern personal computer has
		  managed to survive for~so~long. {\it SHELXL} is the most
		  widely used program for small-molecule refinement and {\it
		  SHELXS} and {\it SHELXD} are often employed for structure
		  solution despite the availability of objectively superior
		  programs. {\it SHELXL} also finds a niche for the
		  refinement of macromolecules against high-resolution or
		  twinned data; {\it SHELXPRO} acts as an interface for
		  macromolecular applications. {\it SHELXC}, {\it SHELXD} and
		  {\it SHELXE} are proving useful for the experimental
		  phasing of macromolecules, especially because they are fast
		  and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for {\it
		  high-throughput} phasing. This paper could serve as a
		  general literature citation when one or more of the
		  open-source {\it SHELX} programs (and the Bruker AXS
		  version {\it SHELXTL}) are employed in the course of a

		  of macromolecules by the SAD, MAD, SIR, SIRAS and RIP

		  structure-solution pipelines. This paper gives a general
		  account of experimental phasing using these programs and
		  describes the extension of iterative density modification
		  in SHELXE by the inclusion of automated protein main-chain
		  tracing. This gives a good indication as to whether the
		  structure has been solved and enables interpretable maps to
		  be obtained from poorer starting phases. The autotracing
		  algorithm starts with the location of possible
		  seven-residue [alpha]-­helices and common tripeptides.
		  After extension of these fragments in both directions,
		  various criteria are used to decide whether to accept or
		  reject the resulting poly-Ala traces. Noncrystallographic
		  symmetry (NCS) is applied to the traced fragments, not to
		  the density. Further features are the use of a `no-go' map
		  to prevent the traces from passing through heavy atoms or
		  symmetry elements and a splicing technique to combine the
		  best parts of traces (including those generated by NCS)
		  that partly overlap.},
